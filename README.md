# predict-car-sales-price
Use k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to predict car prices from multiple features

Link to Jupyter Notebook: [notebook](Basics.ipynb)

After training and testing multiple models, I found the best fit multivariate model was a 3 nearest neighbors model using 5 features for training: *engine_size, highway_mpg, width, city_mpg, curb_weight*.
